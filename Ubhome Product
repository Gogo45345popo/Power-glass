Power Glass refers to a type of glass that is designed to generate electricity while still allowing light to pass through, effectively combining the functions of a solar panel and a window. It's also known as "Solar Windows" or "Photovoltaic Glass".

Here are some key points about Power Glass:

1. Generates electricity: Power Glass contains built-in photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity.
2. Transparent: The glass allows light to pass through, making it suitable for windows and other applications where transparency is important.
3. Energy-efficient: Power Glass can reduce energy consumption by generating electricity on-site, reducing reliance on traditional power sources.
4. Versatile: Can be used for various applications, including windows, facades, and even mobile devices.
5. Aesthetically pleasing: Power Glass has a sleek, modern design that can enhance the appearance of buildings and devices.
